## Welcome to Community Notes's public repository

Please go here to see the original readme: https://github.com/twitter/communitynotes/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file

This is a revised edition of community notes. It fixes some bugs, adds some extra functionality, and most importantly refactors parts of the code so that it will work well with more than one factor. In this readme, I just detail my changes.
